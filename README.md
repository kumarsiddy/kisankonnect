A new Flutter project to show case the design principal in flutter, and using different component efficiently.

This project uses different component as follows :-

    * Bloc Pattern
    * Showing No Internet page automatically when internet connection will not be available.
    * Handling Http Request efficiently by use of singleton and async feature.
    * Handled route (navigation to different screen) using generateRoute and enum.
    * Platform bridge defined to send native instruction to their platform. In this case We are calling android methods to ask for location permission.
    * Sharedpreference usage to cached some data.
    * Customview defined to define once and use whereevere you want.
    * Used colors defined as an enum, so that you don't need to define everywhere in the app. Define once and use whereever you want.
